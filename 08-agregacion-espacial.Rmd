Calculates the **most frequent value** in a dataset.  

## **Minimum**

Calculates the **lowest value** in a time period.  

## **Maximum**

Calculates the **highest value** in a time period.  

## **10th Percentile**

Finds the value below which **10% of the data** fall. Used to measure **low values** or extreme events.  

## **90th Percentile**

Finds the value below which **90% of the data** fall. Used to measure **high values** or extreme events.
