## **📆 Selection of a Specific Interval**

The tool allows you to select a **specific interval within the year** to perform a seasonal analysis.

By enabling the option **“Use only the days of this period of the year”**, a date range is defined (for example, from **March 21 to September 21**) that will be applied to **each year** of the selected period (for example, from 2001 to 2020).

This makes it possible to analyze only certain months or seasons, such as **spring, summer, or growing seasons**.

If you select:

* Start year: 2001  
* End year: 2020  
* From: 21/03  
* To: 21/09  

Only the days between March 21 and September 21 in each of those years will be analyzed, excluding the rest.
