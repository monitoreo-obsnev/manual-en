# Temporal Aggregation Unit {#ud-agregacion-temporal}

Select the temporal interval over which you want to perform the calculations. You can keep the **original temporal resolution of the sensor** or apply a **periodic aggregation** to facilitate the analysis:

## **Original**

Uses the native frequency of the sensor (e.g., daily, 5 days, 16 days, etc.).

## **Every 16 days**

Groups the available observations into 16-day intervals.

## **Monthly**

Summarizes the data by month.

## **Annual**

Generates a single aggregated observation per year.

Temporal aggregation helps smooth short-term variations, facilitate comparisons between periods, reduce the influence of outlier data, or avoid the loss of information caused by cloud presence in the area of interest on specific dates.
