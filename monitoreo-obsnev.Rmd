![](assets/asset_2.png)

Next, exit GEE and return to the MonitorEO app. There, indicate the asset path, i.e., the unique address where the resource is stored within your GEE account.  
This path usually has the following format:  

* **`users/your_user/asset_name`**  

![](assets/asset.png)

## **📌 Specific Point and Buffer**

You can enter **latitude** and **longitude** coordinates to define an exact location on Earth’s surface. From that point, a circular area (**buffer**) can be generated whose **radius, in meters, is defined by the user**. This functionality allows you to delimit areas of interest around a specific point for analysis.  

- Latitude: Enter the latitude in decimal format (for example: -37.6009).  
Use a period (.) as the decimal separator. Do not use commas or additional symbols.  

- Longitude: Enter the longitude in decimal format (for example: -63.854).  
It must also be in decimal format with a period. Remember to use the negative sign if necessary.  

- Radius: Enter the radius in meters (for example: 1000 for one kilometer).  

![](assets/buffer.png)

## **🏞️ National Park**

You can select any of the **National Parks of Spain and Portugal** available on the platform as your study area.  

![](assets/np.png)

## **🌍 World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)**

The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive and up-to-date source of geospatial information on protected areas worldwide. Managed by UN Environment and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), it provides detailed data on national parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas.

To select a protected area by its ID, you can access the database through the official Protected Planet website ([🔗 protectedplanet.net](https://www.protectedplanet.net/)). There, you can search protected areas by name, country, or protection category and obtain their unique identifier (WDPA ID).

# Start and End Dates {#fechas}

Choose the date range for your calculations. First, set the **start year** and **end year**. Then, select the **start month and day**, as well as the **end month and day** to define the analysis period.

![](assets/dates.png)

## **📆 Selection of a Specific Interval**

The tool allows you to select a **specific interval within the year** to perform a seasonal analysis.

By enabling the option **“Use only the days of this period of the year”**, a date range is defined (for example, from **March 21 to September 21**) that will be applied to **each year** of the selected period (for example, from 2001 to 2020).

This makes it possible to analyze only certain months or seasons, such as **spring, summer, or growing seasons**.

If you select:

* Start year: 2001  
* End year: 2020  
* From: 21/03  
* To: 21/09  

Only the days between March 21 and September 21 in each of those years will be analyzed, excluding the rest.


<!--chapter:end:04-periodo.Rmd-->

# Type of Variable of Interest {#tipo-variable}

![](assets/variables.png)

## **🌱 Organic Carbon (Primary Production)** 

### **NDVI** – Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used spectral indicator to quantify vegetation cover and condition through remote sensors. It is calculated from the difference between near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and red (RED) reflectance, normalized by their sum:

NDVI = (NIR − RED) / (NIR + RED)

This index ranges from −1 to 1. Values close to 1 indicate dense and vigorous vegetation, while values near −1 correspond to non-vegetated surfaces, such as water bodies, snow, or urban areas.  

Units: unitless.  

### **EVI** – Enhanced Vegetation Index

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is a spectral indicator developed to optimize the estimation of vegetation cover and condition from remote sensing data. Unlike traditional indices such as NDVI, EVI incorporates atmospheric correction factors and a compensation for soil background influence, improving sensitivity in areas with dense vegetation, low vegetation cover, or complex atmospheric conditions.

The general formula for EVI is as follows:

EVI = G · (NIR − RED) / (NIR + C1 · RED − C2 · BLUE + L)

where:

* NIR: near-infrared reflectance  
* RED: red reflectance  
* BLUE: blue reflectance  
* G: gain factor (generally 2.5)  
* L: soil correction factor (1.0)  
* C1 and C2: atmospheric correction coefficients (6.0 and 7.5, respectively)  

EVI values range from −1 to 1. Values close to 1 indicate dense and healthy vegetation, while negative or low values reflect non-vegetated areas, such as water bodies, urban areas, or snow-covered surfaces.  

| EVI Value | Ecological interpretation |
| ----- | :---: |
| **< 0.0** | Water, snow, clouds, non-vegetated areas |
| **0.0 – 0.1** | Bare soils, deserts, urban areas, rocks |
| **0.1 – 0.2** | Sparse vegetation, arid grasslands, open shrubland |
| **0.2 – 0.3** | Grasslands, rainfed agriculture, savannas |
| **0.3 – 0.5** | Open forests, active croplands (growing crops) |
| **0.5 – 0.7** | Dense temperate forests, croplands with high vegetation cover |
| **> 0.7** | Tropical forests, jungles, very dense vegetation |

Units: unitless.  

### **Chl-a** – Chlorophyll-a Concentration

The chlorophyll-a index is used to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a in water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. Chlorophyll-a is the main photosynthetic pigment present in phytoplankton, so its concentration serves as an indirect indicator of algal biomass and primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. It is a key indicator for assessing water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems (Gitelson et al., 1993; IOCCG, 2000).  

Units: mg m⁻³.

## **🌞 Radiation Balance**

### **ALB** – Albedo

Albedo is the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected by a surface without being absorbed. It is a unitless parameter ranging from 0 (total absorption) to 1 (total reflection). A high albedo indicates that the surface reflects a large proportion of the incoming solar energy, as is the case with highly reflective surfaces such as snow or ice. In contrast, a low albedo implies greater radiation absorption, typical of dark surfaces such as urban areas, wet soils, or water bodies.  

Albedo plays a key role in the Earth’s energy balance and processes related to global climate, as it directly influences the amount of energy entering and retained in the climate system.  

Units: unitless.  

---

## **💧 Water Balance**

### **ET** – Evapotranspiration

Estimate of the amount of water that evaporates from the Earth’s surface and is transpired by plants. Generated from the Mu et al. (2011) model, which implements an approach based on the Penman-Monteith equation, adapted for remote sensors. It helps to understand the water cycle, assess water availability in a region, and monitor water resources.  

Units: Kj/m²/8days.  

### **LE** – Latent Heat

Indirect estimate of the energy consumed by evapotranspiration. During this process, energy is required to break or form bonds between molecules, resulting in the release or absorption of heat. Latent heat plays a fundamental role in the water cycle, as evaporation and condensation are key processes in cloud formation, precipitation, and climate regulation.  

Units: J/m²/day.  

### **LSWI** – Land Surface Water Index

The LSWI is a spectral index used to detect and evaluate the presence of moisture on the land surface, particularly in vegetation and soil. It is based on the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance, which are sensitive to water content in vegetation and soil.

LSWI = (NIR − SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)

* NIR: Near-infrared band  
* SWIR: Shortwave infrared band  

**High values** → high surface moisture, wet soils, vegetation with high water content, wetlands, or irrigated croplands.  
**Low values** → dry conditions, stressed vegetation, or arid soils.  

Units: unitless.  

### **NDWI** – Normalized Difference Water Index

The NDWI is a spectral index designed to detect and quantify the presence of water on the Earth’s surface. It is based on the difference in reflectance between near-infrared (NIR) and green (GREEN), taking advantage of the strong absorption of water in NIR and its high reflectance in the visible range.

NDWI = (GREEN − NIR) / (GREEN + NIR)

* GREEN: Green band  
* NIR: Near-infrared band  

**NDWI > 0** → presence of **surface water** (rivers, lakes, reservoirs, flooded areas)  
**NDWI < 0** → **non-water terrestrial surfaces** (vegetation, bare soil, urban areas)  

Units: unitless.  

### **NDSI** – Normalized Difference Snow Index

The NDSI is a spectral indicator used to detect the presence and extent of snow on the Earth’s surface. It is based on the distinctive reflective properties of snow, which reflects strongly in the visible spectrum (green band) and absorbs significantly in shortwave infrared (SWIR), in contrast with most other land cover types.

NDSI = (GREEN − SWIR) / (GREEN + SWIR)

* GREEN: Green band  
* SWIR: Shortwave infrared band  

**NDSI > 0.4** → high probability of **snow or ice presence**  
**NDSI < 0.2** → generally indicates **absence of snow**  

These thresholds may vary depending on the resolution and sensor used.  

Units: unitless.

## **🌡️ Sensible Heat**

### **LST** – Land Surface Temperature

Land Surface Temperature (LST) refers to the temperature recorded in the upper layer of the Earth’s surface or water bodies, as detected by remote sensors. LST is estimated from thermal radiance captured in the thermal infrared spectrum and is a key variable in analyzing processes such as energy balance, evapotranspiration, drought, water stress, and urban or agricultural monitoring.  

Units: °C.  

---

## **💨 Nutrients / Aerosols**

### **ARSL** – Aerosol Optical Depth

Amount of aerosols in the total atmospheric column. It is used to quantify how much aerosol load is present in the atmosphere. The total aerosol optical depth refers to all aerosol types, while some satellite products provide information on the optical depth of a specific aerosol type, such as dust optical depth, which quantifies the dust load in the atmospheric column.  

Units: unitless.

# Satellite Sensor {#sensor}

Select which sensor you want to work with. The available sensors have different temporal and spatial resolutions. Depending on the chosen variable, you will have data availability from one or another sensor.  

![](assets/sensor.png)

## **🛰️ MODIS 250 m, 16 days**

MODIS (*Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer*) is a sensor onboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites.  

**Spatial resolution:** Depends on the selected variable. Data may be available at 250 m, 1 km, 4 km... This information will appear in the "Sensor" tab once you have selected your variable.  
**Temporal resolution:** Depends on the selected variable. Data may be daily, every 8 days, or every 16 days. This information will appear in the "Sensor" tab once you have selected your variable.  

For this interface, data from **MODIS Terra collections** have been used.  

These satellites **provide data from** **24/02/2000 to the present**, although availability may vary depending on the selected variable.  

---

## **🛰️ Landsat 30 m, > 16 days**

The **Landsat** series is operated by NASA and the USGS. These data include Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9.  

**Spatial resolution:** 30 meters.  
**Temporal resolution:** Greater than 16 days, since depending on the satellite, revisit periods are 8 or 16 days each.  

The **date range** covered is from **1984 to the present**, depending on the availability of each satellite:  

- **Landsat 5** (16/03/1984 – 05/05/2012)  
- **Landsat 7** (28/05/1999 – present, with limitations since 31/05/2003 due to ETM+ failure)  
- **Landsat 8** (18/03/2013 – present)  
- **Landsat 9** (31/10/2021 – present)  

Between **05/05/2012 and 18/03/2013**, no data are available due to the interruption of Landsat 7 imaging. Although this satellite continued operating, its usefulness had been limited since 2003 by a failure in the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Due to this limitation, from 2003 onwards, its data are not considered within the full available date range.  

---

## **🛰️ Sentinel-2 10 m, 5 days**

The **Sentinel-2** program is operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) and is part of the Copernicus program.  

**Spatial resolution:** 10 meters.  
**Temporal resolution:** 5 days.  

In this interface, we use the **SR Harmonized** product, a Surface Reflectance (SR) product adjusted to ensure consistency between Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B sensors through atmospheric correction, spectral adjustment, and data normalization.  

The **date range** of this sensor is from **28/03/2017 to the present.**  

<!--chapter:end:06-sensor.Rmd-->

# Temporal Aggregation Unit {#ud-agregacion-temporal}

Select the temporal interval over which you want to perform the calculations. You can keep the **original temporal resolution of the sensor** or apply a **periodic aggregation** to facilitate the analysis:

![](assets/aggregation.png)

## **Every 16 days**

Groups the available observations into 16-day intervals.

## **Monthly**

Summarizes the data by month.

## **Annual**

Generates a single aggregated observation per year.

Temporal aggregation helps smooth short-term variations, facilitate comparisons between periods, reduce the influence of outlier data, or avoid the loss of information caused by cloud presence in the area of interest on specific dates.

<!--chapter:end:07-agregacion-temporal.Rmd-->

<!--chapter:end:09-agregacion-interanual.Rmd-->

# Cloud Filtering {#filtrado-nubes}

![](assets/filter.png)

When this box is checked, a **scene-based cloud filter** will be applied. Scene-based cloud filtering is a process used in satellite image analysis to remove or reduce the interference caused by the presence of clouds in each image, improving data quality. As a result, analyses will more accurately reflect the actual characteristics of the Earth’s surface.

You can set a % cloud cover threshold, which will discard scenes or images that exceed the defined limit.
